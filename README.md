# Cybercrime Data Mining Project – IT326

## Project Goal
In this project, We aim to analyze cybercrime data in order to study the impact of various attack characteristics, such as attack type, severity, duration, and the size of affected data, in addition to the nature of targeted systems, security protection tools, and response time, on the outcome of cyberattacks.

The project seeks to deepen the understanding of the most influential factors that lead to the success or failure of cyberattacks, and to extract meaningful patterns and relationships between variables using data mining techniques. This will contribute to supporting security decision-making, improving protection and mitigation strategies, and enhancing early detection and effective response to cyber threats.

## Dataset Source
Cyber Crimes Dataset – Kaggle  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shakirul09/cyber-crimes-dataset

## Target Variable
The selected target variable for this project is:

**outcome** – which represents whether the cyberattack was successful or failed.

## Related Research
The paper *“Cyber Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning”* was selected as a related study.  
Although it uses a different dataset, its methodology and focus on applying machine learning techniques to analyze cyberattacks align with the goal of our project and support the analysis of the outcome variable.
